## 🚀 Project Overview

**Spam Mail Prediction** is a machine learning project that classifies emails or text messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and process text data and a machine learning model to predict whether a message is spam.

The project includes:
- A **trained ML model** (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression).
- A **Flask web app** to test predictions in real time.
- **Preprocessing pipeline** for text cleaning and vectorization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a spam classifier using real-world email datasets.  
- Preprocess raw text using NLP techniques.  
- Train and evaluate a classification model.  
- Deploy the model using a simple Flask-based web interface.

## 🧩 Features

✅ Clean and preprocess text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)  
✅ Convert text into numerical vectors (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)  
✅ Train a spam classifier (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)  
✅ Save and load trained models using `pickle`  
✅ User-friendly web interface built with Flask  
✅ Instant spam prediction results
